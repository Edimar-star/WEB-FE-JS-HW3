# WEB-FE-JS-HW3

You will develop an html page where you will explain the following JavaScript topics:

1. JavaScript Async
2. Callback
3. Promise
4. Async/Await
5. Event Loop

You can use any folder and file structure you wish. It will be a blog-like page where you will explain what each topic means and add a code example. Remember to use the html tag to write code. It is not necessary that the page is responsive but if you want to do it is well accepted. The page must be in English. You will have to deploy the page in GitHub pages and share the final result.

Remember, the objective of this assignment is for you to learn these concepts, to understand them correctly.
